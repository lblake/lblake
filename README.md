### About Me

I'm a dedicated Frontend Shopify Developer specializing in creating seamless online stores. With expertise in Shopify theme development, I excel at building visually stunning and user-friendly e-commerce experiences. I possess a solid understanding of React and its components, leveraging them to enhance Shopify themes with dynamic and interactive elements.

I recently completed the comprehensive FreeMote Freelance Developer Bootcamp offered by 'https://www.freemote.com/' I've also completed a 'Full-Stack Bootcamp' rum by 'https://www.techreturners.com/' in collaboration with 'Northcoders' (https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp), equipping me with a comprehensive skill set for freelance success.

Active participation in Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/) has sharpened my knowledge of CSS, JavaScript, and React skills, enabling me to deliver exceptional user interfaces.

I bring extensive experience in Shopify development, proficiency in React, and a diverse skill set acquired through the bootcamp(s). I'm actively seeking new projects to bring captivating online stores to life.

Let's collaborate and create an impactful e-commerce presence!. <br>
