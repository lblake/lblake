### About Me

I am Frontend Web Developer who loves learning new technologies. I set myself a goal to gain an understanding of how React and it's related components work together. During this process I was mentored by a Senior Software Engineer from Cinch.co.uk, who helped me level up my technical skills, showing me different ways to resolve my issues, and how to write clean and modular code. I have created a number of projects from Frontend Mentor, and some set by my mentor. The end result was I gained a deeper understanding of how to create React apps and websites using web technologies such as CSS, JavaScript & React and I'm ready to take on new challenges. <br>
